Re-DTR Notes

- Our group is doing well, but not as well as we could be doing
- We need to focus more on communication and allowing everyone to voice their ideas
- Ways that we can improve communication: be conscious of interrupting others, raise hands if you want to say something, talking stick?
- Still want to finish all functionality by Tuesday check-in
- Our workflow so far is fine, keep pairing when possible and mark features as in-progress on Waffle
- All PRs need comments from people who did not work on the feature, the last reviewer can merge the PR
- Plan for the 3-day weekend: Meeting together at Turing on Saturday and Monday. On Saturday night we will assign features to work on remotely and come back as a group to reevaluate on Monday.
